EBS CSI Plugin configuration:


The Amazon EBS CSI Driver  lets your Kubernetes Pods use Amazon EBS volumes as persistent storage

The Amazon EBS CSI plugin requires IAM permissions to make calls to AWS APIs on your behalf.

Create an IAM role and attach a policy. AWS maintains an AWS managed policy or you can create your own custom policy.
You can create an IAM role and attach the AWS managed policy with the following command. Replace my-cluster with the name of your cluster. 
The command deploys an AWS CloudFormation stack that creates an IAM role and attaches the IAM policy to it.

eksctl create iamserviceaccount \
    --name ebs-csi-controller-sa \
    --namespace kube-system \
    --cluster <YOUR-CLUSTER-NAME> \
    --role-name AmazonEKS_EBS_CSI_DriverRole \
    --role-only \
    --attach-policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonEBSCSIDriverPolicy \
    --approve


The IAM service account (ebs-csi-controller-sa) created by this eksctl command is assigned to the EBS CSI driver in your EKS cluster.


Run the following command. Replace with the name of your cluster, with your account ID.

eksctl create addon --name aws-ebs-csi-driver --cluster <YOUR-CLUSTER-NAME> --service-account-role-arn arn:aws:iam::<AWS-ACCOUNT-ID>:role/AmazonEKS_EBS_CSI_DriverRole --force


--force: This flag forces the creation of the add-on, even if the add-on already exists. 
It's useful when you want to overwrite or reinstall the add-on, potentially after an update or if the installation was unsuccessful previously.


Note: If your cluster is in the AWS GovCloud (US-East) or AWS GovCloud (US-West) AWS Regions, then replace arn:aws: with arn:aws-us-gov:.
